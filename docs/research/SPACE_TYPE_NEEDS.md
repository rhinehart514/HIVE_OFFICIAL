# Space Type Needs: Ground Truth Research

> What each of HIVE's 4 space types actually need — sourced from real tools, real complaints, real money, and real workflows.

---

## 1. Student Organizations (Clubs, Interest Groups, Student Government)

### Current Tool Stack

| Tool | What It Does | Who Uses It | Cost |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **CampusGroups** (Ready Education) | Org directory, event management, membership, payments, chat | Mandated by university (Cornell, CWRU, others) | Institutional license |
| **Presence / Modern Campus Involve** | Event check-in, org management, co-curricular transcripts, assessment | Mandated by university (replaced OrgSync at many schools) | Institutional license |
| **Engage (Anthology)** | Successor to OrgSync. Org registration, event management, forms, funding requests | Mandated by university (GW, others) | Institutional license |
| **Suitable** | Mobile-first engagement tracking, co-curricular transcripts, badging | Institutional | Institutional license |
| **GroupMe** | Group messaging for clubs, classes, dorms | Ubiquitous among students — free | Free |
| **Instagram** | Event promotion, recruitment marketing, culture signaling | 95% of students use it | Free |
| **Discord** | Voice channels, persistent chat, role-based access | Growing adoption, especially tech/gaming clubs | Free |
| **Slack** | Channel-based messaging, integrations | Some orgs, especially professional/pre-career clubs | Free tier |
| **WildApricot** | Membership management, website builder, event registration | Used by 100+ student orgs independently | $60-$420/mo |
| **Google Drive / Docs** | Document storage, meeting minutes, shared files | Universal | Free |
| **Canva** | Flyers, social media graphics, recruitment materials | Universal | Free tier |
| **Venmo / Zelle** | Informal dues and event payment collection | Peer-to-peer | Free |
| **When2Meet** | Scheduling / availability coordination | Common for officer meetings | Free |

### Pain Points (What Breaks)

1. **The Handoff Catastrophe**: Every May, graduating leaders take institutional knowledge with them. Clubs "start over every fall semester because incoming leaders weren't made aware of where the club left off." Position manuals exist in theory; in practice, they're a Google Doc someone forgot to share.

2. **Recruitment Funnel Collapse**: High initial turnout at involvement fairs, then "lose the majority of members as the year goes on." No system tracks who showed interest, who came once, who's drifting. It's GroupMe messages into the void.

3. **Communication Fragmentation**: Announcements split across GroupMe (urgent), Instagram (public), email (official), and the university platform (compliance). Members miss things constantly. "Teams are leaving GroupMe" but there's no clear replacement.

4. **University Platform Friction**: CampusGroups, Presence, and Engage are mandated by the institution but designed for administrators, not students. Setup complexity creates adoption friction. Students use them only when forced (event registration, funding requests).

5. **Funding is a Maze**: SGA funding processes require filling out forms on institutional platforms, waiting weeks for approval, and never spending before approval arrives. At Northeastern, 222 orgs requested $6.8M and got $4M allocated — most orgs get the median of ~$5,855/year. The tools for requesting are clunky; tracking spend is manual.

6. **No Recruiting Pipeline for Leaders**: "All current leadership is graduating and they need to recruit passionate underclassmen." There's no system for identifying, developing, or transitioning future leaders. It's ad hoc mentorship at best.

### Semester Lifecycle

| Month | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **August** | Re-registration opens (mandated by university). Officer info updates due. Org fair prep. Constitution review. |
| **September** | Involvement fair (biggest recruitment moment). First meetings. Membership drives. Budget requests submitted to SGA. |
| **October** | Programming ramps up. Events, speakers, socials. Midterm slowdown hits attendance. |
| **November** | Elections begin for spring/next year officers. Homecoming events. Fundraising pushes. |
| **December** | Semester wrap. End-of-semester reports. Holiday events. Everything goes quiet. |
| **January** | Spring re-activation. New member recruitment (smaller). Spring budget cycle. |
| **February-March** | Peak programming. Conferences. Spring break planning. Midterms again. |
| **April** | Officer transition. Elections finalize. End-of-year banquets. Senior sendoffs. |
| **May** | Handoff. Knowledge transfer (or loss). Everything gets lost in the shuffle. |

### The Handoff Problem

The transition checklist that actually matters (and rarely gets done):
- Transfer all account credentials (social media, email, platforms)
- Pass down contact lists (alumni, advisors, vendors, venue contacts)
- Share the "timetable of activities" — what happens each month
- Review the budget and financial state
- Transfer documents, meeting minutes, event histories
- Introduce incoming officers to key campus contacts

**What actually happens**: Outgoing president sends a GroupMe message saying "good luck," maybe shares a Google Drive folder, and graduates. The new president spends September figuring out what the org even does.

### The Money Question

- **SGA Funding**: Varies wildly. Northeastern allocates ~$4M across 204 orgs ($19,733 avg, $5,855 median). Notre Dame distributes $350K across all clubs. Ohio State caps at $3,000-$4,500/org/year.
- **Dues**: Most clubs don't charge dues. Those that do use Venmo/Zelle informally. No invoicing, no tracking, no late payment follow-up.
- **Fundraising**: Bake sales, merch, sponsorship asks. All tracked in spreadsheets if tracked at all.
- **Student Activity Fee**: Built into tuition ($101/semester at Pace). Students don't see it; it funds the org ecosystem.

### What They Wish Existed

- A single place where everything lives (not 7 apps)
- Automatic knowledge transfer between leadership generations
- A way to actually track who's engaged vs. who joined the GroupMe and disappeared
- Event promotion that reaches beyond existing members
- Budget tracking that isn't a spreadsheet

### Compliance & Reporting

- Annual re-registration with the university (officer info, constitution, advisor signatures, minimum 10 members)
- Risk management training (state-mandated at some schools, annual)
- Sexual violence prevention training for officers
- Funding reports if they received SGA money
- **Consequence of non-compliance**: Org gets "frozen" — loses room booking, funding access, and directory listing

## 2. University Organizations (Career Center, Student Affairs, Health Services, Academic Departments)

### Current Tool Stack

| Tool | What It Does | Who Uses It | Cost |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Presence / Modern Campus Involve** | Event management, attendance tracking, co-curricular transcripts, learning outcomes assessment | Student affairs divisions | Institutional license |
| **Suitable** | Co-curricular engagement tracking, experiential learning badges, competency mapping | Career services, student affairs | Institutional license |
| **Handshake** | Career services platform, employer connections, job/internship postings | Career centers | Institutional license |
| **EAB Navigate** | Student success, advising, early alerts, appointment scheduling | Academic advising, student success offices | Institutional license |
| **Raftr** | Mobile-first digital communities by interest, program, or residence hall | Student affairs, housing, multicultural offices | Institutional license |
| **Banner / Ellucian** | SIS, student records, enrollment management | University-wide backend | Enterprise license |
| **Slate** | CRM for admissions, events, communications | Admissions, enrollment management | Enterprise license |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Staff communication, some student-facing channels | Administrative teams | Institutional license |
| **Qualtrics** | Surveys, assessment, student satisfaction measurement | Assessment offices | Institutional license |
| **25Live** | Room/space scheduling and event management | Events, facilities | Institutional license |

### Pain Points

1. **Data Silos Everywhere**: Student affairs, career services, housing, advising — each has its own platform with its own student engagement data. No unified view of a student's involvement. A student who's struggling might be flagged in advising but their deep involvement in three clubs (a protective factor) is invisible.

2. **Engagement Measurement is Broken**: Universities need to prove co-curricular engagement matters for retention and outcomes. Current tools count attendance at events (swipe-in at the door) but can't measure depth of involvement, skill development, or belonging.

3. **Communication Doesn't Reach Students**: 72% of students prefer mobile notifications over email. University offices still rely heavily on email blasts, physical flyers, and portal announcements. Students don't check any of these.

4. **Assessment for Accreditation**: Accreditors want evidence that co-curricular programs contribute to learning outcomes. Current tools provide attendance counts, not learning evidence.

5. **Staff Turnover in Student Affairs**: High turnover in student affairs means institutional knowledge about programs, partnerships, and what works gets lost — the same handoff problem as student orgs, but at the staff level.

### What University Orgs Actually Need From a Platform

- **Reach students where they are** (mobile, push notifications, not email)
- **Track engagement depth**, not just attendance counts
- **Connect siloed data** — a student's involvement profile visible across departments
- **AI-driven personalization** — recommend events, resources, connections based on student behavior
- **Assessment dashboards** for accreditation reporting
- **Seamless event management** that students actually use (not another portal login)

### The Money Question

- University orgs have institutional budgets, not student-managed funds
- They purchase software through enterprise procurement (long sales cycles, RFP processes)
- Budget decisions made annually, usually 12-18 months ahead
- Student activity fee revenue gets distributed through committee processes

### Compliance & Reporting

- Accreditation requirements (NASPA/ACPA competencies, CAS standards)
- Title IX compliance for programs
- Clery Act reporting (including new 2024 hazing reporting requirements)
- DEI metrics and programming documentation
- Student learning outcomes assessment
- Retention and persistence data tied to engagement

## 3. Residential (Dorms, Floors, Housing Communities)

### Current Tool Stack

| Tool | What It Does | Who Uses It | Cost |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **StarRez** | Housing management — assignments, billing, room selection, maintenance requests | Housing operations (37% of Roompact campuses use it) | Enterprise license |
| **eRezLife** | Housing applications, room selection, roommate matching | Housing operations | Enterprise license |
| **Roompact** | Residence life & education — curriculum tracking, roommate agreements, duty logs, intentional conversations, program proposals, assessment | RAs, residence life professional staff | Enterprise license (est. 2013) |
| **GroupMe** | Floor/building group chats | RAs and residents | Free |
| **Instagram** | Floor/building social accounts for community building | RAs | Free |
| **Canva** | Door decs, bulletin boards, program flyers | RAs | Free |
| **Microsoft Teams / Email** | Staff communication, daily check-ins required | RA staff (must check minimum once daily) | Institutional |
| **Google Forms** | Program proposals, feedback surveys, event RSVPs | RAs | Free |
| **Raftr** | Digital communities for residence halls | Some institutions | Institutional license |

### Pain Points

1. **Roompact is the Only Res Life-Specific Tool — and It's Admin-Focused**: Roompact tracks what the institution needs (curriculum delivery, duty logs, roommate agreements) but doesn't help RAs actually build community. It's compliance software, not community software.

2. **RAs Are Drowning in Manual Work**: Programming requirements (8-10 events per semester at some schools), plus duty logs, incident reports, roommate mediations, bulletin boards, intentional conversations — tracked across multiple systems or on paper.

3. **Floor Community Dies After Week 3**: Move-in energy is high, first floor meeting attendance is great, then it drops off a cliff. RAs have no tools to maintain engagement. GroupMe becomes a ghost town. Events get 3 attendees on a floor of 40.

4. **No Digital Layer for Physical Community**: Residence halls are the most natural community unit on campus (you literally live together) but have the worst digital infrastructure. No floor directory, no shared calendar, no way to organize spontaneous hangouts.

5. **Theme Communities Need More**: Living-learning communities, themed floors (wellness, honors, sustainability) have programming requirements but no digital home. Students in these communities "generally have a greater sense of community and belonging" — but the tech doesn't support the model.

6. **RA Transition is Annual and Total**: Every May, the entire RA staff turns over. All the relationship-building, community knowledge, and institutional memory leaves. The incoming RA starts from zero with residents they've never met.

### RA Programming Requirements (By Institution)

Requirements vary significantly, but common patterns:
- **Minimum events per semester**: 8-10 individually, plus 1+ building-wide collaborative program
- **Category requirements**: Must cover diversity, academic success, wellness, social, community service
- **Residential curriculum model**: Many schools have moved from "programming model" (RA picks topics) to "curriculum model" (department defines learning outcomes, RA delivers)
- **Documentation**: Program proposals submitted in advance, attendance tracked, post-event assessments filed
- **Intentional conversations**: 1-on-1 conversations with each resident (some schools require all residents, some require at-risk residents)

### Semester Lifecycle (Residential)

| Month | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **August** | RA training (1-2 weeks intensive). Move-in. First floor meetings. Roommate agreements. Door decs. |
| **September** | Community building programming peaks. Floor bonding events. Getting-to-know-you activities. First duty rotations. |
| **October** | Programming continues. Midterm stress — RAs shift to wellness/academic support programming. Roommate conflicts emerge. |
| **November** | Engagement drops. Homesickness. Roommate issues peak. Room change requests. Thanksgiving break logistics. |
| **December** | Finals programming (stress relief, study breaks). Move-out logistics. Semester evaluations. |
| **January** | Some RA turnover (new hires for spring). New residents arrive. Community re-building. |
| **February-March** | Spring programming. RA selection process for next year begins. Spring break logistics. |
| **April** | RA selection finalized. Current RAs help train successors. End-of-year programs. Room selection for next year. |
| **May** | Move-out. RA evaluations. Complete handoff to incoming staff. Total knowledge loss. |

### What Residential Communities Actually Need

- **A digital layer for the physical community**: Floor directory, shared calendar, spontaneous hangout coordination, marketplace/borrow-lend
- **RA workflow tools**: Program proposal submission, attendance tracking, duty scheduling, incident reporting — in one place, not five
- **Community pulse**: Simple way to gauge floor energy, surface residents who are isolated, track engagement over time
- **Persistent community identity**: Something that survives RA turnover — floor traditions, shared memories, community norms
- **Connection to broader campus**: Residence hall communities are insular by default. Tools should bridge to campus-wide involvement.

### The Money Question

- RAs are compensated with room and board (worth $8,000-$15,000/year depending on institution)
- Programming budgets are typically $200-$500/semester per RA, managed through the housing department
- Residents don't pay fees beyond room and board
- All technology is institutionally purchased and mandated

## 4. Greek Life (Fraternities, Sororities, Councils)

### Current Tool Stack

| Tool | What It Does | Who Uses It | Cost |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **OmegaFi** | Full-service: dues billing, financial management, alumni CRM, national reporting. FDIC-insured accounts, spending controls, budget calculators. | Large nationally-governed chapters | $$$ — enterprise pricing |
| **Greekbill** | Traditional billing and payment tracking. Structured workflows for dues collection. | Chapters wanting structured billing (since 1998) | Subscription |
| **LegFi** | Modern billing, member engagement, financial management for treasurers | Chapters wanting modern finance tools | Subscription |
| **Greek Connect** | Chapter management: events, attendance tracking, RSVPs, excuses, group chats | Collegiate Greek orgs (iOS, Android, web) | Subscription |
| **OurHouse** | Highest-rated in Greek industry. Native mobile app. Replaces Facebook groups, GroupMe, manual attendance. Geolocation attendance, points, appeals. | Chapters wanting all-in-one (built by former exec officers) | Subscription |
| **Agora** | FREE all-in-one: announcements, attendance, dues/budgets, forms, calendars, merch orders. Built by frustrated fraternity leaders. | 100+ chapters | **Free** |
| **GreekTrack** | Membership, event management, SaaS platform | Greek chapters | Subscription |
| **OmegaRecruit** | Recruitment-specific: PNM tracking, bid list compilation, electronic voting, preference management | Sorority recruitment (Panhellenic) | Part of OmegaFi |
| **ChapterBuilder / MyVote (Phired Up)** | Recruitment CRM, member selection tools | IFC/Panhellenic councils | Subscription |
| **CampusDirector** | Recruitment management, PNM Companion App, MRABA process | Panhellenic councils | Subscription |
| **GroupMe** | Chapter communication, committee chats, pledge class groups | Universal among Greek orgs | Free |
| **Venmo** | Informal payments, social dues, event costs | Members | Free |
| **Instagram** | Recruitment marketing, chapter culture signaling, event promotion | Every chapter | Free |
| **Google Drive** | Meeting minutes, chapter documents, transition binders | Officers | Free |

### Pain Points

1. **Tool Sprawl is Extreme**: A single chapter might use OmegaFi for billing, OurHouse for attendance, GroupMe for communication, Instagram for recruitment, Google Drive for documents, Venmo for informal payments, and CampusDirector for formal recruitment. Nothing talks to anything else.

2. **Dues Collection is the #1 Pain Point**: Average dues range from $500-$3,000/semester. New member costs are highest due to one-time initiation fees. Collecting from 50-150 members, tracking who's paid, chasing late payments, managing payment plans — it's a part-time job for the treasurer. OmegaFi claims to boost dues collection by 20%.

3. **Officer Transition is a Semester-Long Crisis**: Greek chapters have 10-15 officer positions, each with complex responsibilities. Transition involves passing down contacts, timetables, budgets, vendor relationships, and "complex knowledge built from experience, judgment, and context." Each position should have a manual; most don't. The NIC provides transition checklists; few chapters actually use them.

4. **Nationals vs. Chapter Tension**: National organizations mandate specific reporting (scholarship, community service hours, finances, recruitment numbers, risk management compliance). Chapters must report up, but the tools nationals use often don't match what chapters use day-to-day.

5. **Recruitment is High-Stakes and Poorly Tooled**: Formal recruitment (especially Panhellenic sorority recruitment) is an elaborate multi-day process involving hundreds of PNMs, scoring rubrics, mutual selection algorithms (MRABA), and bid matching. The technology exists (OmegaRecruit, CampusDirector) but it's expensive, clunky, and only used during rush week.

6. **Compliance is Getting Heavier**: The Stop Campus Hazing Act (December 2024) adds new Clery Act reporting requirements. Universities require anti-hazing training, social event registration, community service documentation, GPA reporting, and risk management compliance. Chapters must track and report all of this.

7. **Alumni Engagement Drops Off a Cliff**: After graduation, chapter members disappear from the chapter's digital ecosystem. Alumni databases exist in nationals' systems but chapters lose the connection. Alumni are the primary donors and mentors — losing them costs real money.

### Semester Lifecycle (Greek Life)

| Month | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **August** | Officer retreat. Rush/recruitment prep. PNM outreach begins. House move-in (if applicable). |
| **September** | **RUSH WEEK** — the most intense period. Formal recruitment, bid day, new member education begins. Chapter registration with university and IFC/Panhellenic. |
| **October** | New member education continues. Philanthropy events. Homecoming. Brotherhood/sisterhood events. First round of dues collection. |
| **November** | Initiation (some chapters). Formal/semi-formal planning. Nationals reporting deadlines. Standards board activity increases. |
| **December** | Finals. Chapter review. End-of-semester nationals reports. |
| **January** | Spring recruitment (informal/COB for IFC, some sorority recruitment). Budget planning. Officer elections begin. |
| **February-March** | Philanthropy season peaks. Greek Week. Officer elections finalize. Spring formal planning. |
| **April** | Officer transition. Outgoing officers train incoming. End-of-year banquet. Awards. |
| **May** | Seniors graduate. Knowledge transfer (or loss). Summer planning for fall recruitment begins. House closes (if applicable). |

### The Handoff Problem (Greek-Specific)

Greek chapters have the most structured transition process of any student org type — and it still fails regularly.

What should happen:
- Each outgoing officer creates a position manual with duties, deadlines, contacts, and lessons learned
- Incoming officers shadow outgoing officers for 2-4 weeks
- Retreat with both outgoing and incoming executive boards
- Transfer of all accounts, credentials, vendor relationships, and alumni contacts
- Budget handoff with full financial state review

What actually happens:
- President sends a GroupMe message
- Treasurer sends the spreadsheet
- Social chair shares the Instagram password
- Everyone else wings it

### The Money Question

**Dues**: $500-$3,000/semester per member. For a 80-member chapter at $1,500/semester: **$120,000/semester flows through the chapter**. This is real money requiring real financial management.

**Breakdown of where dues go**:
- National dues/insurance: $200-$800/semester per member
- Chapter operations: $100-$400/semester
- Social/event fund: $100-$500/semester
- House/facility fund (if applicable): $200-$1,000/semester
- Philanthropy allocation: varies

**Additional money flows**:
- Philanthropy fundraising: $5,000-$50,000/year for active chapters
- Alumni donations: varies wildly
- Merch sales
- SGA funding (some chapters eligible for event funding)

### Compliance & Reporting

| Requirement | Who Requires It | Frequency |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Scholarship/GPA report | Nationals, University, IFC/Panhellenic | Semester |
| Community service hours & money raised | Nationals, University | Semester |
| Recruitment report (pledged, initiated, demographics) | Nationals, IFC/Panhellenic | Per cycle |
| Financial report / budget | Nationals | Annual or semester |
| Social event registration | University Greek Life office | Per event |
| Anti-hazing compliance forms | University, Nationals | Annual |
| Risk management training completion | University (state-mandated in some states) | Annual |
| Officer/roster updates | University, Nationals | Semester |
| Standards/conduct violations | IFC/Panhellenic, University | As needed |
| Hazing incident reports (NEW - Stop Campus Hazing Act 2024) | University (Clery Act) | As needed |

### What Greek Life Wishes Existed

- One platform that handles billing, communication, attendance, and reporting (not 6+ tools)
- Automated nationals reporting from the same data they already track
- A recruitment CRM that works year-round, not just during rush week
- Alumni engagement tools that don't feel like LinkedIn
- Financial transparency dashboards that every member (not just the treasurer) can see
- Transition tools that make officer handoff automatic, not heroic

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes (All 4 Space Types)

### 1. The Handoff Problem is Universal
Every space type suffers from annual knowledge loss. Student orgs lose everything in May. RAs turn over completely. Greek officers rotate. Even university staff turns over. **The platform that solves persistent institutional memory wins.**

### 2. Tool Fragmentation is the Norm
No space type uses fewer than 5 tools. Most use 8-12. GroupMe + Instagram + Google Drive + institutional platform + domain-specific tool + Venmo + Canva + email. **The platform that consolidates even 3 of these wins adoption.**

### 3. Institutional Platforms Serve Admins, Not Students
CampusGroups, Presence, Engage — they're built for the student affairs office to track and report. Students use them only when forced. **The platform that students actually want to open wins the data.**

### 4. Communication is Solved (Badly)
GroupMe won by default. It's free, everyone has it, it works. But it's terrible for anything beyond real-time chat: no threads, no organization, no history that's findable, no permissions. **The platform that replaces GroupMe for org communication captures the daily habit.**

### 5. Money Flows Through Student Orgs With Zero Infrastructure
From $5,855 median SGA allocations to $120K/semester Greek chapter budgets — real money moves through student organizations with Venmo, spreadsheets, and prayer. **The platform that handles money handles power.**

### 6. Engagement Drops After Week 3
Every space type reports the same pattern: high energy at the start (involvement fair, move-in, rush week), then rapid decline. No tool currently solves sustained engagement. **The platform that keeps people coming back after the honeymoon wins everything.**

## Competitive Landscape Summary

| Platform | Primary User | Strength | Weakness | Pricing |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------|---------|
| CampusGroups | University admins | Comprehensive institutional tool | Students hate using it | Institutional |
| Presence / Modern Campus Involve | Student affairs | Assessment, co-curricular transcripts | Admin-focused, not student-facing | Institutional |
| Suitable | Student affairs | Mobile-first engagement tracking | Institutional buyer, not student-adopted | Institutional |
| OmegaFi | Greek nationals/chapters | Financial management, billing | Expensive, steep learning curve | $$$ |
| OurHouse | Greek chapters | Best-rated Greek app, native mobile | Greek-only | Subscription |
| Agora | Greek chapters | Free, built by students | Greek-only, new (100 chapters) | Free |
| Roompact | Residence life staff | Only res life-specific tool | Admin/compliance focused, not community | Institutional |
| StarRez | Housing operations | Housing management backbone | Operations only, no community | Enterprise |
| Raftr | Student affairs / housing | Mobile-first communities | Institutional buyer | Institutional |
| GroupMe | Everyone | Universal adoption, free | No organization, no persistence, no structure | Free |
| Discord | Tech/gaming clubs | Powerful, flexible, free | Learning curve, not mobile-first for non-gamers | Free |

## HIVE Opportunity Map

| Space Type | Biggest Unmet Need | HIVE's Angle |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Student Orgs** | Persistent institutional memory + consolidated tooling | Be the operating system for clubs — not another admin portal |
| **University Orgs** | Reaching students where they are + engagement depth data | Be the student-facing layer that feeds institutional data needs |
| **Residential** | Digital community layer for physical spaces | Be the floor/building community that RAs wish they could build |
| **Greek Life** | Consolidation of 6+ tools + automated compliance | Be the chapter OS that replaces the spreadsheet-GroupMe-Venmo stack |

### The Through-Line

Every space type needs the same three things:
1. **A place that persists** — survives leadership transitions, staff turnover, graduation
2. **A place students actually use** — not because they're forced, but because it's useful daily
3. **A place that does real work** — manages money, tracks engagement, coordinates events, stores knowledge

HIVE doesn't need to replace every tool. It needs to be the **connective tissue** between the tools that already exist and the communities that use them — while solving the handoff problem that no one else has cracked.
