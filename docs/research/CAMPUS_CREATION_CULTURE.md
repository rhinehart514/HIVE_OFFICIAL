# Campus Creation Culture Research

What today's college students (born 2002-2007) actually build, how they build it, and what creation means to them.

---

## 1. The Hackathon Machine

### Scale
- MLH's 2025 hackathon season: **150,000+ hackers across 184 hackathons**, producing **12,500+ projects** in a single season
- TreeHacks (Stanford) is the largest collegiate hackathon in the U.S.
- ShellHacks (Florida), MHacks (Michigan), HackHarvard, HackPSU all draw hundreds of teams

### What They Build
The dominant categories in 2024-2025:

**AI everything.** The overwhelming trend. Students are stitching together GPT-4, Claude, Gemini APIs with frameworks like LangChain, Semantic Kernel, and AutoGen to build:
- DECO.ai (MHacks 1st place) -- AI interior design assistant generating 3D room visualizations
- Terminal.AI (MHacks 2nd place) -- AI error explanations directly in the terminal
- Braillearn (nwHacks 2025 finalist) -- helping visually impaired users learn Braille
- Nested (Google AI Hackathon winner) -- city relocation matching based on Google Maps history

**Health/accessibility projects** are the second biggest category. Mental health screening, personalized therapy bots, accessible education tools.

**The "fix my campus" projects** are telling: practice SAT environments, course scheduling tools, roommate matching. Students build solutions to their own daily friction.

### Tools They Use
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML/CSS/JS for responsive UIs
- **Backend:** Python (dominant), Node.js
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenAI API, Claude API, Hugging Face models, BERT/GPT variants
- **Cloud:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Vercel
- **AI Agents:** Semantic Kernel, AutoGen, Azure AI Agents SDK
- **Pattern:** Students don't build from scratch anymore. They **assemble**. API calls to LLMs + pre-trained models + cloud hosting + a React frontend. The "full-stack" hackathon project is now an **integration project**.

### Key Insight
The hackathon generation doesn't see building as "programming." They see it as **wiring things together**. The API is the new lego brick.

## 2. Student-Built Apps That Escaped

### Recent Successes
- **Howbout** -- Built by three university best friends to stay connected after graduation. Now **4 million+ users**, $11.2M raised (including $8M Series A in Sept 2024). Solves the "losing touch" problem.
- **Fizz** -- Anonymous campus social app, claimed **95% of Stanford undergrads** downloaded it. Spread campus-by-campus with ambassador programs.
- **Stimy** -- AI math tutor, raised $425K pre-seed in 2024
- **Revyze** -- Student-created education platform, raised $8M total

### Pattern: What Student Apps Solve
1. **Social connection** (staying in touch, meeting people, campus community)
2. **Academic friction** (course selection, professor ratings, study tools)
3. **Identity/expression** (anonymous posting, campus culture)
4. **Daily logistics** (scheduling, roommates, buying/selling)

They don't build enterprise software. They build **things they personally need** and then discover others need them too.

---

## 3. Class Projects That Launched

### Georgia Tech CREATE-X Pipeline
Georgia Tech's CS Capstone now explicitly bridges classroom to startup. In their entrepreneurial Junior Design Capstone, 16 teams go from zero to working prototype in four months. Top scoring projects get **automatic acceptance into CREATE-X Launch**, the school's startup accelerator.

Example: **LunchBox** -- helps parents of neurodivergent children navigate safe-food options. Built by computational media students in a capstone, then accelerated into a real company.

### MIT 2.009
MIT's legendary product design class has spawned dozens of startups. **Avive** (portable AED charged by cell phone battery) went from class project to funded startup to real medical device company.

### UT Dallas UTDesign
Companies that sponsor capstone projects often **put student code directly into production**.

### Key Insight
The pipeline from "class assignment" to "real product" is shorter than ever. Universities are building explicit on-ramps (CREATE-X, MIT sandbox, etc.) because students are already trying to launch from class.

---

## 4. Student Startups 2024-2025

### Y Combinator's Bet on Students
YC launched **"Early Decision"** -- apply now, get funded, do YC after graduation. No more dropout mythology.

**Spur** (AI QA testing tools) applied through Early Decision in fall 2023 while in school, graduated May 2024, joined Summer 2024 batch, raised **$4.5M**.

YC held the first **AI Startup School** in June 2025 in San Francisco: 2,500 top CS undergrads, with speakers including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Satya Nadella, Andrej Karpathy.

### Competition Winners (2024-2025)
- **Maro** (SXSW EDU 2024 winner) -- early mental health interventions for students
- **Stick 'Em** (2025 Hult Prize, $1M) -- details not public yet
- **Slammed U** (Penn State) -- roommate matching and campus community platform
- **Rice Business Plan Competition** -- $1.5M+ in prizes across student startups

### What Problems They Solve
1. **Mental health** -- screening, intervention, wellness tools (huge category)
2. **Education quality** -- AI tutoring, learning tools, accessibility
3. **Campus community** -- matching, connection, belonging
4. **Daily campus friction** -- scheduling, logistics, communication

### Key Insight
The YC Early Decision program signals something important: the startup ecosystem now **accommodates** student founders rather than demanding they drop out. This normalizes building-while-learning.

## 5. The Roblox/Minecraft Generation Grows Up

### Creation as Native Language
Today's college freshmen (born ~2006) were **8-10 years old** when Roblox hit mainstream. They didn't just play games -- they **built** games, worlds, economies, and social spaces.

- Roblox creators earned **$923M in 2024** (up 25% from $741M in 2023)
- Gen Z's internet culture is defined by **"Creative Maximalism"** -- chaotic visuals, participatory storytelling, overlapping layers of meaning
- They're not watching culture happen; they're **building it in real time, together**

### What This Means for HIVE
This generation's default mode is **creation, not consumption**. They grew up with:
- **Roblox Studio** -- free game development, 3D modeling, basic coding
- **Minecraft** -- collaborative world-building, redstone "programming"
- **YouTube/TikTok** -- content creation as self-expression
- **Canva** -- design as a daily tool, not a professional skill
- **Notion** -- information architecture as personal practice

They don't distinguish between "users" and "builders." The line doesn't exist for them. Building is just what you do on a computer.

### The Creator Identity
**83% of Gen Z consider themselves "creators"** (YouTube Culture & Trends Report 2024). Only 28% formally identify as "content creators" -- meaning the majority see creation as something they *are*, not something they *do for an audience*.

**58% of Gen Z are actively involved in content creation** -- creating and sharing videos online.

### Key Insight
For this generation, a platform that doesn't let you build/customize/create feels **broken**. Consumption-only platforms feel like TV -- something for older people. The expectation is participation.

## 6. What Students Cobble Together (The Duct Tape Stack)

### The Venmo Problem
Almost every university **bans student organizations from using Venmo, Zelle, or CashApp** for dues and fees. Princeton, Boise State, Carnegie Mellon, Binghamton all explicitly prohibit it. They call digital payment apps "outside bank accounts."

**What actually happens:** Students use personal Venmo accounts anyway. Some universities (Northwestern) eventually gave in and created official University Venmo accounts for student orgs. The workaround became the policy.

### The Google Forms Everything
Student orgs use Google Forms for:
- Event registration (with response limits as "capacity management")
- Member applications and recruitment
- Meeting attendance tracking
- Budget request submissions
- Feedback and surveys

Google Forms + Google Sheets = the unofficial student org operating system.

### The Communication Chaos
Students manage orgs across:
- **GroupMe** -- the default for class groups, clubs, friend groups
- **Instagram** -- the public face, event promotion, recruitment
- **Discord** -- for tech-adjacent orgs, gaming clubs, CS groups
- **Slack** -- sometimes for "professional" clubs
- **iMessage group chats** -- for executive boards

No single platform. Communication is the #1 cited pain point for student org management.

### The Design Problem
Student orgs need flyers, social media posts, banners, presentations. Solution stack:
- **Canva** -- 40%+ of students at top 100 universities use it
- Template-first design (50% of higher ed Canva designs start from templates)
- Instagram story templates passed between org generations

### Key Insight
Student organizations run on **consumer tools duct-taped together**. Every org reinvents the same operational wheel every year. Knowledge transfer between exec boards is abysmal -- when officers graduate, institutional knowledge evaporates. The tooling gap is enormous.

---

## 7. Student Government Technology

### How SGAs Actually Operate
Most student governments run on:
- **Google Sheets** for budgets (Georgia Tech SGA 2024-2025 budget is literally a public Google Sheet)
- **University "Engage" platforms** (OrgSync, CampusLabs, Suitable) for official processes
- **Custom-built tools** at tech schools (Georgia Tech SGA IT Board)

### Georgia Tech's SGA IT Board (Notable Exception)
Georgia Tech's SGA has a dedicated **IT Board** with software engineers, product managers, and UI designers. They build and maintain student tools:
- **Course Critique** -- schedule planning tool, originally from 1976, rebuilt by students
- GitHub security improvements
- Surveying tools for student organizations
- Data retention policies

Students work on AWS and Plesk platforms, mirroring industry standards. The IT Board gives members real production experience.

### The Reality at Most Schools
Most SGAs don't have this. They manage million-dollar budgets on spreadsheets. "Budgets" (annual allocations) and "Bills" (rolling requests) are processed through clunky university systems or paper forms.

### Key Insight
Student government is both the biggest potential user of better tools AND the most underserved. They manage real money, real elections, real policy -- with consumer-grade or worse tooling.

## 8. Campus Tools That Went Viral

### The Playbook: How Campus Apps Spread

**Piazza (2009-2020s)**
- Created by Pooja Nath at Stanford GSB in 2009
- 600 Stanford students by February 2010
- Opened to all institutions January 2011; 330+ schools by summer 2011
- Spread through **faculty adoption** -- one professor adopted it, students loved it, told other professors
- Killed by: switching to paid model in 2020, data privacy concerns (sharing student data with employers)
- Replaced by: Ed Discussion (better privacy, accessibility, free)

**Coursicle**
- Built to solve one problem: "notify me when a class has an open seat"
- Spread from school to school in 2015-2016 (Notre Dame, Brown, Penn, App State)
- Integrated RateMyProfessors scores directly into course browsing
- Viral because it solved an **urgent, time-sensitive, universal** campus problem

**Fizz / Sidechat / Yik Yak**
- Hyper-local (5-mile radius around campus)
- Ambassador-driven launch: set up tables, hand out swag, create initial content
- Fizz claimed 95% of Stanford undergrads
- Sidechat acquired Yik Yak, creating market consolidation
- Competition was fierce and physical -- when Fizz launched at Colgate, Sidechat set up a competing table the same day, chanting "Fizz has hackers"
- Universities eventually began banning these apps (UNC system banned Yik Yak, Fizz, Sidechat, Whisper in 2024)

**GroupMe**
- Free, works with SMS (no smartphone required initially)
- Became default for class groups because **one person creates the group and adds everyone**
- No signup friction -- you can be added by phone number
- Sticky because switching costs are social, not technical

**RateMyProfessors**
- Launched 2008 era, became universal through pure word-of-mouth
- Survives because the data is **uniquely valuable** and **nowhere else**
- Students contribute because they benefit from others' contributions -- classic network effect

### Viral Patterns
1. **Solve one urgent problem** (open seats, professor quality, anonymous expression)
2. **Campus-by-campus launch** with ambassadors or faculty champions
3. **Zero or near-zero friction** to start using
4. **Network effects** -- more valuable as more students join
5. **Student-to-student spread**, not top-down institutional adoption

### Key Insight
Every viral campus tool was **built by students for students** and spread through peer networks. Institutional adoption follows student demand, never the reverse. The winning pattern is: solve one thing perfectly at one campus, then replicate.

## 9. Content Creation as Default Mode

### The Numbers
- **83%** of Gen Z consider themselves creators
- **58%** actively create and share content
- **28%** formally identify as content creators
- Gen Z spends **2 hours 55 minutes/day** on social media
- Top career aspirations for Gen Alpha: YouTuber and TikTok creator

### Creation vs. Consumption
Gen Z doesn't see a hard line between creating and consuming. They:
- Watch a TikTok, then make a response/duet
- See a Canva design, then remix it for their org
- Use a Notion template, then customize it extensively
- Play a Roblox game, then build their own version

The **remix** is the native creative act. Not from-scratch creation, but taking something existing and making it theirs.

### From Content to Utility
The creation instinct isn't limited to entertainment content:
- Students who make TikToks also make Canva flyers for their clubs
- Students who built Roblox games also build course scheduling tools
- The skill is **"make a thing on a computer"** -- the output varies

### Key Insight
Creation fluency is the defining characteristic of this generation. They grew up remixing, building, and sharing. A platform that harnesses this instinct for campus utility -- not just content -- taps into something fundamental.

## 10. No-Code and Tool Adoption on Campus

### Notion
- **Free Plus Plan** for individual students (with .edu email)
- **Free Plus Plan** for student organizations (unlimited members, application required)
- **Campus Leaders Program** -- student ambassadors hosting events, building templates, providing feedback
- "Student Org In-a-Box" template for managing resources, teams, meetings
- Students build and share templates in a template marketplace
- Notion has become the **default organizational brain** for tech-savvy student orgs

### Canva
- **40%+ of students** at top 100 U.S. universities use Canva
- Higher ed community is **25% more active** than average Canva users
- **650 million designs** published by students, faculty, and staff in 2024 (20/second)
- **85 million** Canva for Education users (42% increase from 2023)
- 50% of higher ed designs start from templates
- University of Portland reduced design turnaround by **98%** using Canva

### Airtable
- Used by student orgs for event tracking, member databases, project management
- Spreadsheet-database hybrid appeals to students who outgrow Google Sheets
- Free tier accessible for student budgets

### The No-Code Generation
The 2025 no-code landscape includes tools students actively use:
- **Notion** for knowledge management and org operations
- **Canva** for visual design
- **Airtable** for structured data
- **Zapier** for automation between tools
- **Figma** for UI/UX design (especially in CS/design programs)

### Key Insight
Students are already using creation/no-code tools for organizational work -- just **scattered across 5+ platforms** with no integration. The tooling exists in fragments. Nobody has unified it for the campus context.

## Synthesis: The Creation Culture of Today's College Students

### Who They Are
Today's college students are the first generation where **building digital things is a basic literacy**, not a specialized skill. They grew up on Roblox, Minecraft, YouTube, TikTok, Canva, and Notion. 83% call themselves creators. They don't distinguish between "tech people" and "everyone else" -- they distinguish between "people who build things" and "people who haven't found the right tool yet."

### Their Comfort Level
- **High comfort** with assembling tools, APIs, and templates into solutions
- **High comfort** with visual/design tools (Canva, Figma, Notion)
- **Moderate comfort** with code (CS students build full apps at hackathons; non-CS students use no-code tools confidently)
- **Very high comfort** with remixing -- taking templates, tutorials, and existing projects and adapting them
- **Low tolerance** for blank-canvas friction -- they want starting points, not empty editors

### What Excites Them
1. **AI-powered creation** -- the hottest hackathon category by far. Students are energized by the idea that they can build things that were previously impossible.
2. **Solving their own problems** -- the most successful student projects solve campus friction (course scheduling, roommate matching, community building)
3. **Speed to something real** -- hackathon culture (build in 24-48 hours) has set expectations. They want to see results fast.
4. **Social creation** -- building with friends, for their community, with visible impact. Solo creation in a vacuum is not appealing.
5. **Template-first workflows** -- start from something good, make it theirs. Not "create from scratch."

### What They Don't Care About
- Polish and perfection (ship it, iterate)
- Professional-grade tools with steep learning curves
- Building things nobody will use
- Solo creation without social context
- Tools that require institutional approval or IT department involvement

### The Gap HIVE Can Fill
Students are already:
- Building tools at hackathons that solve campus problems (but die after the weekend)
- Running organizations on duct-taped consumer tools (Google Forms + Venmo + GroupMe + Instagram + Canva)
- Using Notion/Canva/Airtable for org operations (but fragmented across platforms)
- Creating content constantly (but not channeling it into campus utility)

Nobody has given them a **unified creation platform inside their campus community**. The tools exist. The instinct exists. The problems exist. The integration doesn't.

### Implications for HiveLab
1. **Template-first, not blank canvas.** Start with "Student Org Event Page" or "Club Budget Tracker" -- not "Create New Project."
2. **Assembly over coding.** The hackathon pattern is wiring APIs together. HiveLab should feel like connecting blocks, not writing from scratch.
3. **Social by default.** Everything created should be visible, shareable, and remixable within the campus community.
4. **Solve real campus friction.** The winning student tools all solved one specific, painful problem. HiveLab should make solving those problems trivially easy.
5. **Speed to impact.** If it takes more than 30 minutes to have something working, it's too slow. The hackathon generation expects immediate results.
6. **AI-native.** This generation expects AI assistance as a baseline. "Describe what you want, then customize" is the expected workflow.
7. **Mobile-first creation.** These students live on their phones. If creation requires a desktop, adoption drops.
8. **Remix culture.** Let students fork, adapt, and build on each other's creations. The best Roblox games spawned thousands of variations. Campus tools should work the same way.
