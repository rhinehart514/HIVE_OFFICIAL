*This list is actually made by students who know what college is really like, not some LinkedIn influencer trying to "connect with Gen Z" 💀*

**Anti-Features:**
- No LinkedIn integration (we're not LinkedIn, thank god)
- No "professional networking" cringe
- No GroupMe chaos import
- No Facebook connection (that's for boomers)
- No "campus ambassador" MLM vibes
- Actually works unlike every other campus app that dies after semester 1

**UB Real Talk:**
- We know you're just here because SUNY was cheap
- We know you complain about the weather but stay anyway
- We know you've gotten lost in Capen at least once
- We know you've waited 20 minutes for the bus in -10° weather
- We know you've pretended to be sick to avoid walking to class in a blizzard

*Built different because we actually go here* 🦬
