# Campus Reality: University at Buffalo

What UB students actually do, what actually hurts, and what HIVE has to reckon with before shipping a single feature.

---

## The Campus at a Glance

- **Total enrollment:** ~32,000 (20,400 undergrad, 11,500 grad)
- **Record first-year class Fall 2025:** 5,019 freshmen (+21% YoY)
- **Commuters:** 72%+ of the student body
- **International students:** ~8,400 from 100+ countries (India and China dominant)
- **First-generation students:** 30% of undergrads
- **Pell grant eligible:** 33%+
- **Registered clubs:** 500+
- **Gender split:** 54% male, 46% female
- **Campuses:** North (Amherst, suburban, main academic hub), South (University Heights, urban, arts/humanities), Downtown (medical/clinical)
- **Division I athletics:** MAC conference, ~540 student-athletes

UB is not a small liberal arts college where everyone bumps into each other at the dining hall. It is a massive, geographically fragmented, majority-commuter research university where anonymity is the default experience.

## Student Segments & Behavioral Maps

### 1. Freshmen (Residential, North Campus)

**Who:** ~5,000 first-year students, mostly living in dorms on North Campus. First time managing their own schedule. High social anxiety masked by performative excitement.

**Daily rhythm:**
- Morning: Roll out of dorm, walk to class in Davis/Knox/Baldy cluster
- Midday: Student Union food court, Capen Library, awkward lunch alone or with hallmates
- Afternoon: More classes or dead time in dorm
- Evening: Dining hall, then isolation in dorm rooms. Maybe a club meeting if they found one during Fall Welcome
- Weekend: South Campus bar scene (upperclassmen), Netflix in dorm (freshmen)

**Key behavior:** Freshmen make 80% of their involvement decisions in the first 3 weeks of fall semester. If they don't connect with something by October, they likely won't until spring -- and many won't try again. The activities fair during Fall Welcome is a firehose: 500+ tables in a field, sensory overload, sign up for 20 email lists, follow through on zero.

**Pain:** They signed up for clubs at the fair. Then got 50 emails they ignored. Never heard back about when meetings actually happen. Felt too awkward to show up alone to something they barely remember signing up for. The GroupMe invite expired or they never got added.

**What they actually use:** Instagram (discovery/FOMO), GroupMe (class chats, dorm chats), Snapchat (friends from home), TikTok (background noise). UBLinked only when forced by an RA or orientation leader.

### 2. Commuters (72% of Student Body)

**Who:** The silent majority. Drive or bus to campus, attend class, leave. Some live in apartments near South Campus/University Heights. Some drive 30+ minutes from Cheektowaga, Tonawanda, Williamsville. Some are parents. Some work 20-30 hours/week.

**Daily rhythm:**
- Arrive on campus 15 min before class
- Class
- Maybe grab food at the Union
- Class
- Drive home
- No organic "hallway moments," no dining hall conversations, no late-night dorm bonding

**Key behavior:** Commuters self-select out of involvement because logistics defeat them. A club meeting at 7pm means staying on campus for 4 extra hours after their last class ends at 3pm. They don't have a place to hang out, store their stuff, or decompress between obligations. Campus is transactional: get in, get educated, get out.

**Pain:** They feel like ghosts. They see residential students forming friend groups and assume they missed their window. Nobody designed anything for their schedule. They don't know what's happening on campus because they're not physically there to see flyers or hear word-of-mouth. UBLinked's event calendar doesn't filter by time-of-day or "things happening right now between my classes."

**What they actually use:** GroupMe (class-specific chats only), Google Calendar, maybe nothing campus-specific at all.

### 3. International Students (~8,400)

**Who:** Largest populations from India and China, but 100+ countries represented. Graduate students skew heavily international. Many arrive knowing nobody, speaking English as a second or third language, culturally disoriented.

**Daily rhythm varies by origin:**
- Chinese students: Tight-knit WeChat groups, Chinese Student Association events, often socialize within language/cultural bubble. Cook together, study together, live in same apartment complexes
- Indian students: WhatsApp groups organized by program (MS CS, MS DS, MBA), Indian Student Association, cricket on weekends, heavy reliance on upperclassmen networks for housing/jobs
- Others: More isolated, fewer established pipelines, rely heavily on International Student Services programming

**Key behavior:** International students form parallel social infrastructure. They don't use the same tools as domestic students (WeChat vs. GroupMe, WhatsApp vs. Discord). They attend different events. They have different needs (immigration help, cultural adjustment, English practice, finding ethnic groceries). The university's involvement platforms are English-only, culturally American, and assume a set of social norms that don't apply.

**Pain:** Loneliness hits hardest in the first month. University orientation is information-heavy and relationship-light. Cross-cultural friendships are rare unless structurally forced. Many want to integrate but don't know how. The cultural organizations provide safety but can also become silos.

**What they actually use:** WeChat (Chinese), WhatsApp (Indian, Middle Eastern, African), Instagram, country-specific Facebook groups, word-of-mouth through program cohorts.

### 4. Club Leaders & Organizers (~2,000-3,000 active)

**Who:** The students who run the 500+ clubs. E-board members, event planners, recruitment chairs. Disproportionately juniors and seniors. Often over-committed across 3-5 organizations.

**Daily rhythm:**
- Constant context-switching between academics, org leadership, and personal life
- Spend hours on admin: booking rooms through UB's clunky reservation system, filing budget requests through SA, designing Instagram posts in Canva, managing GroupMe/Discord chaos
- Weekly e-board meetings, general body meetings, event planning sessions
- Semester-start recruitment push, then engagement cliff by week 6

**Key behavior:** Club leaders are the unpaid infrastructure of campus social life. They burn out by junior spring. Institutional knowledge dies every May when seniors graduate. Handoff is a Google Doc (if you're lucky) or a "figure it out" text. SA (Student Association) funding requires bureaucratic paperwork that takes weeks. Room booking conflicts are constant. UBLinked's admin interface is a chore.

**Pain:** They spend more time on logistics than on the actual mission of their org. Recruiting members is easy (activities fair), retaining them is nearly impossible. They can't tell who actually came to events vs. who just RSVPed. They have no way to communicate with members that doesn't involve maintaining a separate GroupMe/Discord. Event promotion is Instagram-or-nothing, and the algorithm buries student org content.

**What they actually use:** Instagram (marketing), GroupMe (member comms), Google Drive (docs/planning), Canva (design), UBLinked (required for SA compliance, budget requests, room booking), personal group chats for e-board.

### 5. Student Athletes (~540)

**Who:** D1 MAC conference athletes. Rigid schedules: practice, travel, academic requirements. Insular social circles centered on team. Time-poor but high-status.

**Daily rhythm:**
- Early morning: Workouts/practice
- Classes structured around practice schedule
- Afternoon: Practice, film, training room
- Evening: Study hall (mandatory for some), team dinners
- Weekends: Games, travel

**Key behavior:** Athletes exist in a parallel campus. They have a built-in community (team) but limited bandwidth for anything outside it. They're often visible on campus (gear, size, recognition) but socially isolated from the broader student body. SAAC provides some cross-sport connection.

**Pain:** They want to be seen as more than athletes but don't have time to prove it. Missing events because of travel. Feeling disconnected from "normal" college life. After their sport ends (injury, eligibility), identity crisis hits hard.

**What they actually use:** Team GroupMe, Instagram, whatever their athletic department mandates (TeamWorks, ARMS, etc.).

### 6. Engineers/CS Students (North Campus)

**Who:** School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, housed in the Davis/Bell/Bonner/Furnas/Jarvis/Ketter complex on North Campus. Heavy course loads, lab-intensive, career-focused. CS is the largest major.

**Daily rhythm:**
- Classes and labs clustered on North Campus
- Capen Library or Davis Hall study rooms until midnight
- Hackathons (UB Hacking), ACM meetups, project teams
- Job/internship hunt dominates junior/senior year

**Key behavior:** CS students form tight communities around shared suffering (algorithms, OS, capstone). ACM and hackathon culture create natural gathering points. But many CS students -- especially international grad students -- exist outside these communities and study alone. The department is "small and tight-knit if you choose to be part of it" -- but choosing requires social activation energy many don't have.

**Pain:** Imposter syndrome. Project teams forming through existing friend groups, leaving outsiders out. Career anxiety. The gap between "I can code" and "I have a network."

### 7. Business Students (School of Management)

**Who:** Alfiero Center, North Campus. Professional-track culture. Suits for presentations. Networking is the curriculum.

**Daily rhythm:**
- Classes, case competitions, club meetings
- Professional development events (ALPFA, Beta Alpha Psi, finance clubs)
- Recruiting season dominates fall

**Key behavior:** Business students are the most "involved" segment because involvement IS the product (resume lines, network connections). They join 4-5 professional orgs. But it's transactional -- attendance drops after recruiting season ends. The School of Management has its own club directory separate from UBLinked, creating information fragmentation.

### 8. Arts/Humanities Students (Split Across Campuses)

**Who:** College of Arts and Sciences is the largest academic unit (29 departments). Physically dispersed. Theater in the Center for the Arts (North), some humanities on South Campus.

**Key behavior:** Less structured involvement culture. More likely to find community through classes, studio time, performance groups. Often overlooked by the "involvement industrial complex" that caters to business/engineering/pre-med.

## Daily / Weekly / Semester Cycles

### When Students Need Connection Most

| Period | What's Happening | Emotional State |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Week 1 (Fall)** | Move-in, orientation, activities fair | Excited but terrified. Maximum openness to new things. Maximum vulnerability. |
| **Weeks 2-3** | Classes start, routines form | Realization sets in: "I don't have a group yet." Panic joining. |
| **Weeks 4-6** | First exams, midterms approach | Stress isolation. The clubs they joined feel like obligations. Attendance drops. |
| **Weeks 7-9** | Midterms, fall break | Loneliness peaks for those who haven't connected. Go home for break, don't want to come back. |
| **Weeks 10-12** | Post-midterm, pre-finals lull | Second wind for some. Others have given up on the semester socially. |
| **Weeks 13-15** | Finals, semester end | Survival mode. Social life dies. Promise to "do more next semester." |
| **January** | Spring semester starts | Lower energy than fall. Transfer students arrive with zero social capital. No activities fair equivalent. |
| **February-March** | Winter grind | Buffalo winter is brutal. -10F, gray skies, dark by 5pm. Campus feels dead. Loneliness compounds. |
| **April** | Spring thaw, end in sight | Energy returns. Events pick up. But it's too late for deep friendships -- everyone's already in their groups. |
| **May** | Finals, graduation | Leaders graduate. Knowledge dies. Clubs scramble for succession. |

### The Critical Windows

1. **First 21 days of fall semester** -- This is when involvement decisions are made. If HIVE isn't capturing students here, it doesn't matter how good the product is.
2. **Sunday nights** -- Peak loneliness across all segments. The week ahead feels overwhelming. No plans = dread.
3. **Between-class gaps** -- Commuters especially. 90-minute gap with nothing to do and nowhere to go. This is dead time that could be connection time.
4. **Post-midterms slump (Week 8-9)** -- Students who haven't found their group are at highest risk of disengagement.
5. **Buffalo winter months (Jan-March)** -- Physical isolation compounds social isolation. Nobody wants to walk to a club meeting in a blizzard.

## Top 10 Real Pain Points

Ranked by severity -- how many students are affected and how deeply it hurts.

### 1. The Discovery Black Hole

**Severity: Critical**

500+ clubs exist. Students know about maybe 10. UBLinked is a database, not a discovery engine. It's alphabetical, category-based, and assumes students know what they're looking for. The activities fair is a one-day firehose that overwhelms rather than guides. Instagram discovery is algorithm-dependent and favors established orgs. Word-of-mouth only works if you already have a mouth to hear from.

**Who it hurts most:** Freshmen, commuters, international students, transfer students -- anyone without an existing network.

### 2. The Follow-Through Collapse

**Severity: Critical**

Students sign up for 15 things at the activities fair. They get added to 0-3 GroupMes. They receive sporadic emails they ignore. They never hear about the first meeting, or they hear about it but feel too awkward to show up alone. The gap between "interest expressed" to "first real participation" is where 80% of potential involvement dies.

**Who it hurts most:** Everyone, but especially introverted students and those without a friend to bring along.

### 3. The Commuter Exclusion

**Severity: Critical**

72% of UB students are commuters. The entire involvement infrastructure -- meeting times, event schedules, club culture -- is designed for residential students. Meetings at 7pm. Events on Friday nights. Study groups that form organically in dorms. Commuters are structurally excluded from the social fabric of the university.

**Who it hurts most:** 23,000+ commuter students.

### 4. Information Fragmentation

**Severity: High**

A student's campus information is scattered across: UBLinked (clubs), UB Events calendar (official), Instagram (org-run), GroupMe (informal), email (official comms), HUB Student Center (academics), Canvas (classes), UB Mobile app, department websites, and physical flyers. No single source of truth. No unified timeline. Students miss things constantly because they didn't check the right platform at the right time.

**Who it hurts most:** Everyone, but especially new students who don't know which platforms matter.

### 5. The Leadership Knowledge Death Spiral

**Severity: High**

Every May, senior club leaders graduate. They take institutional knowledge with them. The next cohort starts from scratch: re-learning SA budget processes, room booking systems, event planning workflows, member databases. Some clubs die entirely because no one knows how to run them. There's no persistent organizational memory.

**Who it hurts most:** Club leaders, the organizations themselves, and future members who would have benefited.

### 6. Cross-Cultural Isolation

**Severity: High**

International students (26% of campus) operate in parallel social systems. Chinese students on WeChat, Indian students on WhatsApp, American students on GroupMe/Instagram. These systems don't intersect. University programming attempts at "cultural exchange" feel forced. Organic cross-cultural connection requires shared context (classes, projects, interests) that current tools don't surface.

**Who it hurts most:** International students who want to integrate, domestic students who want diverse friendships but don't know how.

### 7. The "Nothing Is Happening Right Now" Problem

**Severity: Medium-High**

Student is on campus with a 2-hour gap. They want to do something -- anything. But they have no way to know what's happening right now, nearby, that they could join. UBLinked shows events days in advance. Instagram shows past events. Nobody is answering the question: "What can I do on campus in the next 60 minutes?"

**Who it hurts most:** Commuters, students between classes, anyone with unstructured time.

### 8. Event Promotion Is Broken

**Severity: Medium-High**

Club leaders spend hours making Instagram posts that reach 200 people. They have no way to target students who would actually care. They compete with every other org for the same eyeballs in the same feed. Turnout is unpredictable. There's no feedback loop: they don't know why people didn't come, just that they didn't.

**Who it hurts most:** Club leaders/organizers.

### 9. The Empty Room Problem

**Severity: Medium**

A student works up the courage to attend a club meeting. They walk in and there are 4 people in a room meant for 40. It feels dead. They don't come back. Meanwhile, the club's GroupMe has 200 members. The gap between "members on paper" and "people who show up" is demoralizing for both leaders and newcomers.

**Who it hurts most:** New members and club leaders.

### 10. No Feedback Loops

**Severity: Medium**

Students don't know if an org is active, healthy, or dying until they show up. There's no signal for "this club meets regularly and people actually like it" vs. "this club registered on UBLinked for funding but hasn't met since October." Leaders don't know which of their events worked and which flopped. The university doesn't know which orgs are thriving and which need support.

**Who it hurts most:** Students trying to evaluate orgs, leaders trying to improve, administrators trying to allocate resources.

## Current Tool Landscape

### What Students Actually Use

| Tool | Use Case | Penetration | Where It Fails |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **GroupMe** | Class chats, club comms, friend groups | ~90% of undergrads | No discovery. No structure. Becomes spam. Can't find old messages. Groups die when semester ends. No events/calendar. |
| **Instagram** | Event promo, org branding, FOMO culture | ~95% | Algorithm buries student org content. Not interactive. No RSVP. No "what's happening now." Performative, not functional. |
| **Discord** | CS/gaming communities, some clubs | ~40% (higher in STEM) | Intimidating for non-tech students. Server sprawl. No campus-wide integration. |
| **Snapchat** | Friends from home, casual social | ~80% | Zero campus utility. Not a tool. |
| **TikTok** | Entertainment, some campus content | ~85% | Consumption only. Not a coordination tool. |
| **WeChat** | Chinese international students | ~95% of Chinese students | Completely invisible to non-Chinese students. Silo. |
| **WhatsApp** | Indian/international students | ~80% of international students | Same silo problem. No discovery. |
| **UBLinked** | Official club directory, event calendar, SA compliance | Required for all clubs | Database, not a product. UX is utilitarian. No engagement features. Students use it when forced. Nobody browses it for fun. |
| **UB Mobile App** | Bus tracking, maps, dining hours | Moderate | Functional but soulless. Not social. |
| **Canvas** | Classes | 100% | Academic only. No social layer. |
| **Email** | Official university comms | 100% (ignored) | Students treat UB email as spam. Open rates likely <15% for non-academic mail. |
| **Google Calendar** | Personal scheduling | ~30% | No social features. Private by default. |

### Where Tools Fail (The Gaps)

1. **No discovery engine.** Nothing answers "what should I join?" based on who I am, what I like, and when I'm available.
2. **No unified timeline.** Campus life is fragmented across 8+ platforms with no aggregation.
3. **No real-time layer.** Nothing answers "what's happening right now on campus?"
4. **No cross-platform bridge.** GroupMe, WeChat, WhatsApp, Discord users are in separate universes with no shared awareness.
5. **No organizational memory.** When a GroupMe dies, that club's history dies with it.
6. **No social proof.** No way to see "50 people are going to this" or "students like you joined this org."
7. **No commuter-aware design.** Nothing filters by "between my classes" or "on my way to campus."

### Institutional Friction

- **UBLinked/Campus Labs Engage** is the mandated platform. Clubs must use it for SA recognition, budget requests, and room booking. But it's an admin tool that students endure, not choose. Any competing platform must either integrate with or deliberately avoid conflicting with UBLinked's institutional role.
- **Room booking** goes through UB's Events Management office. The process involves forms, approval chains, and lead times that make spontaneous events nearly impossible.
- **SA (Student Association) funding** requires detailed budget proposals, receipts, and compliance reporting. The bureaucracy exists for good reasons (accountability) but it's a tax on student energy.
- **University email** is the official channel, but students have trained themselves to ignore it. Any platform that relies on email for engagement will fail.
- **UB's IT infrastructure** is controlled and security-conscious. Integration with university systems requires institutional buy-in that takes months/years.

## The "Disappearance Test"

If HIVE disappeared tomorrow -- given it's been dormant for 2 years -- what would students miss?

**Honest answer: Nothing. Yet.**

HIVE has zero current user base. Zero habits formed. Zero switching cost. The codebase exists. The product thinking exists. But campus reality hasn't been touched by it.

This is both the worst possible position (no traction, no validation, no word-of-mouth) and the best possible position (no legacy users to disappoint, no technical debt to maintain for backward compatibility, freedom to build exactly the right thing).

The question isn't "what would students miss?" It's "what would students miss if it existed and then disappeared?" And the answer to that has to be built around the pain points above:

- They'd miss the thing that told them what to do on a Tuesday at 2pm between classes
- They'd miss the thing that showed them 3 clubs they didn't know existed that are perfect for them
- They'd miss the thing that made showing up to a new org feel normal instead of terrifying
- They'd miss the thing that made their club's event actually get seen by the right people
- They'd miss the thing that survived graduation and kept the org alive

If HIVE can become that, it passes the disappearance test. If it can't, it's another app on a pile of apps that students downloaded during orientation and deleted by October.

---

## Implications for HIVE's Return

### What This Means

1. **HIVE is competing with inertia, not with other apps.** Students don't love their current tools -- they tolerate them. But "tolerable and familiar" beats "better but unknown" every time. HIVE has to be dramatically better at one specific thing, not incrementally better at everything.

2. **The 21-day window is everything.** HIVE's launch must coincide with the start of a fall semester. Any other timing is wasted. And within that window, it must deliver value on day 1, not after a critical mass of users arrives.

3. **Commuters are the underserved majority.** Every campus platform is designed for the 28% who live on campus. Building for the 72% is a strategic moat that no competitor is even attempting.

4. **Club leaders are the distribution channel.** If club leaders adopt HIVE, their members follow. If club leaders don't adopt HIVE, it doesn't matter how good the student experience is. The leader experience must be 10x better than GroupMe + Instagram + UBLinked combined.

5. **Cross-cultural connection is a differentiator nobody else is solving.** If HIVE can bridge the WeChat/WhatsApp/GroupMe divide -- not by replacing those tools but by creating shared awareness across them -- it solves something genuinely new.

6. **The platform must respect UBLinked's institutional role.** HIVE should not try to replace SA compliance tools. It should be the social/discovery/engagement layer that makes UBLinked's data useful. Complement, don't compete.

7. **Real-time > scheduled.** The biggest gap in the current landscape is "what's happening right now." Every existing tool is either backward-looking (Instagram, email) or forward-looking (calendars, event listings). Nobody owns the present tense.

8. **Social proof reduces activation energy.** Students won't go to a club meeting alone. But if they can see that 12 other freshmen are planning to attend, the barrier drops. Making involvement visible and social is more important than making it organized.

*Written for the HIVE strategy sprint. This is ground truth, not aspiration. Every claim above should be pressure-tested against actual UB student conversations before building.*
