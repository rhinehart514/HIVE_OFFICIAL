## How to Use This

1. **Browse by dimension** — Each file is self-contained with current state, ideas, and analysis
2. **Look at Quick Wins vs Moonshots** — Each file categorizes ideas by effort/timeline
3. **Check Wedge Opportunities** — Each file identifies what HIVE can do that incumbents structurally cannot
4. **Cross-reference** — Ideas often span dimensions. Check related files for connected thinking

## Idea Status Legend

Ideas in each file are raw brainstorming. To move an idea toward implementation:
- **Raw** — Just an idea, needs evaluation
- **Exploring** — Actively thinking through tradeoffs
- **Committed** — Decision made, ready for spec
- **Killed** — Evaluated and rejected (with reasoning)
