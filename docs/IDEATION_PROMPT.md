# Ideation

Use this when exploring a new surface or feature. Not for bug fixes or known implementations.

---

## Process

1. **Go wide.** Minimum 5 directions. Include ones you'd initially dismiss.
2. **For each direction:** What's the premise? When does it work? When does it fail?
3. **Find the tensions.** What tradeoffs are unavoidable? Where do we take a stance?
4. **No recommendations until asked.** The point is options, not answers.

---

## Grounding Questions

- What's the actual job this surface does?
- What happens if we don't build this?
- What's the simplest version that would work?
- What would make this embarrassing in two years?
- Who uses this and what are they trying to finish?

---

## Output

For each direction:

```
**Direction: [Name]**
Premise: [One sentence — what this bets on]
Works when: [Conditions where this is the right call]
Fails when: [Conditions where this breaks down]
Tension: [What you give up by choosing this]
```

## Done When

- You explored a direction you didn't expect to
- You can explain the tradeoffs to someone who disagrees
- You're not sure which direction is right (that's the point)
