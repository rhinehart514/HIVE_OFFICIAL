## Why Archived

These files were transactional documents (audits, plans, one-time setup notes) that cluttered the project root. They have been preserved for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Current Documentation

Active project documentation lives in:
- `/docs/` - Primary documentation
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions
- `/README.md` - Project overview
- `/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guide
