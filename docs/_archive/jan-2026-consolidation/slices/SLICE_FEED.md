## The Upstream Problem

Students don't know what's happening.

Events exist but they miss them. Spaces are active but they don't see it. Friends are doing things but they don't know.

Campus life is fragmented across 10 apps, 50 GroupMes, and scattered Instagram stories. There's no single answer to: "What's going on?"

**Feed is the answer to "what's happening?"**

---

## What People Actually Want

Why would a student open Feed? Not "should" — would.

### 1. The "What Did I Miss?" Itch
You've been away. Things happened. You want to know.

**The feeling:** "Let me see what's going on."

### 2. The Social Curiosity
What are people doing? What are my friends up to?

**The feeling:** "What's everyone up to?"

### 3. The Discovery Appetite
Show me something I didn't know existed. Surprise me.

**The feeling:** "What's out there?"

### 4. The Anticipation Check
What's coming? What should I be excited about?

**The feeling:** "What's coming up?"

### 5. The Validation Pulse
Did anyone engage with my stuff? Did my event get RSVPs?

**The feeling:** "Did anything happen with my stuff?"

---

## What Makes It Interesting

Interest = **Relevance + Novelty + Stakes**

### Relevance
"This is about my world."

- My spaces doing things
- My friends going places
- Events I'd actually attend

Generic campus news = boring. My corner of campus = interesting.

### Novelty
"I didn't know that."

- New event I hadn't heard of
- New creation that's clever
- New space matching my interests

Same stuff every day = boring. New discoveries = interesting.

### Stakes
"This matters."

- Event happening SOON (urgency)
- Limited spots (scarcity)
- Friends going (social proof)
- My creation being used (investment)

Nothing at stake = boring. Something at stake = interesting.

---

## The Interest Equation

**Interest = (Relevance × Novelty × Stakes) + Social Signal**

High all = You WILL look at this.
Low all = Invisible.

Feed surfaces high-interest content, not just recent content.

---

## The Feed Layers

### The "Right Now" Layer
What's happening RIGHT NOW.

- Events starting in next few hours
- Spaces active right now
- Creations getting responses now
- Friends who are active now

**Why interesting:** Immediacy creates relevance.

### The "Coming Up" Layer
What's on the horizon.

- Events this week you might like
- Trending RSVPs (momentum visible)
- Countdowns to things you're going to

**Why interesting:** Anticipation is pleasurable.

### The "Your World" Layer
What's happening in your spaces and with your people.

- Activity from your spaces
- What friends are doing
- Your creations getting used
- Your events getting RSVPs

**Why interesting:** It's YOUR world. You're invested.

### The "Discover" Layer
Things outside your world you'd probably like.

- Spaces similar to yours
- Events attended by people like you
- Trending creations
- People you might know

**Why interesting:** Genuine discovery.

---

## Interest Mechanics

### Social Signal
"Sarah is going"
"Jake just created this"
"12 people from your spaces RSVPed"

People you know doing things = inherently interesting.

### Momentum Indicators
"Trending this week"
"15 RSVPs in the last hour"
"Just launched, already 50 responses"

Momentum signals something's happening.

### Temporal Urgency
"Starts in 2 hours"
"Tomorrow"
"Last day to RSVP"

Real timing, not fake scarcity.

### Personal Stakes
"Your event has 23 RSVPs"
"Your creation used 47 times today"

Your stuff being engaged = deeply interesting.

### Novelty Markers
"New space launched"
"First event from this org"
"Just created"

New things make the brain perk up.

---

## The Anticipation Engine

Most feeds are **reactive**: Here's what happened.

HIVE Feed is **anticipatory**: Here's what's coming.

### The Forward Tilt
- Events coming up > events that happened
- RSVPs building > attendance reported
- Countdowns > recaps

**Why:** Anticipation is pleasurable. Looking forward improves life.

### The Countdown Energy
Events approach visibly.

"In 3 days" → "Tomorrow" → "In 5 hours" → "Starting now"

Each step builds excitement.

### The Momentum Visibility
See things gaining energy.

- RSVP counts climbing
- Trending events rising
- Creations getting traction

---

## Content Mix

### Events (Primary)
Inherently interesting: time-bound, social, actionable, anticipatory.

**Card shows:** What, when (countdown), who's going (faces), quick RSVP.

### Creations (Secondary)
What people are making and using.

**Card shows:** What it does, who made it, usage count, quick use.

### Space Activity (Tertiary)
Signs of life from communities.

**Card shows:** What it is, activity indicator, friends who are members.

### Social Activity (Ambient)
What your people are doing. Woven throughout, not primary content.

"Sarah RSVPed to Photography Walk"
"Jake created a new poll"

---

## The Daily Pull

### "What's Today" Question
Every morning: What's happening today?

Feed answers: Events today, activity in spaces, things to look forward to.

### "What Did I Miss" Question
Been away. What happened?

Feed answers: New RSVPs, space activity, new matches.

### "What's Coming" Question
What should I be excited about?

Feed answers: Upcoming events, trending things, friends' plans.

## Structural Classification

### Core User Job
**Know what's happening, what's coming, and what I'd care about.**

**Before:** "I miss events. Campus feels random."
**After:** "I know what's going on. I have things to look forward to."

### Value-Per-Interaction

| Interaction | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Open Feed | Awareness |
| See event | Discovery, anticipation |
| See social signal | Connection |
| RSVP from Feed | Commitment |
| Check your stuff | Validation |

### Compounding

- More events → more to anticipate → more reason to check

## Not Infinite Scroll

Feed has a natural end.

"You're caught up. Here's what's coming this week."

Not endless. Natural stopping points.

**Interest without addiction. Engagement without extraction.**

---

## The Position

**Feed is where you go to know what's happening and have things to look forward to.**

Your window into campus life. Forward-looking. Socially-informed. Actually useful.
