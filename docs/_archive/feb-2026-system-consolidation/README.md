# Archived Docs — February 5, 2026

## Why

These documents were archived during the consolidation to HIVE's **5-system model**:

1. **Identity** — Entry, profiles, campus verification
2. **Spaces** — Communities, chat, membership
3. **Tools** — HiveLab, automations, integrations
4. **Awareness** — Notifications, presence, real-time
5. **Discovery** — Explore, search, recommendations

The new system docs live at `docs/systems/` with paired `_UX.md` files for each system. Strategy-level content was consolidated into `docs/STRATEGY.md`.
