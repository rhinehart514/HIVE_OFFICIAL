# ============================================
# CONTEXT
# ============================================
context:
  who: |
    University at Buffalo students (32k TAM). Primary: club leaders,
    student org presidents, active community members. Secondary:
    general student body seeking campus connection.

  problem: |
    Students use Instagram to coordinate campus life, but Instagram
    was built for global audiences, not campus communities. Students
    can't find events, can't coordinate groups, can't build campus
    identity. They have no control over the tools that shape their
    daily life.

  market: |
    Campus social/coordination market. Competitors: Instagram (dominant
    but wrong product), GroupMe (messaging only), university apps (unloved).
    Window: 2025-2026 while campus social is fragmented.

  timing: |
    January 2026 production launch at UB. Leader-first GTM with 400+
    pre-seeded spaces. Win UB first, then expand to other campuses.

# ============================================
# THESIS
# ============================================
thesis: |
  Students will adopt HIVE if it gives them genuine control over their
  campus experience - finding what's happening, joining communities that
  matter, building campus identity, and creating their own content.

  The key insight: Instagram is "owned" by Meta. HIVE is owned by students.
  This ownership difference creates a fundamentally different product.

# ============================================
# CONSTRAINTS
# ============================================
constraints:
  - "Use locked primitives - no custom CSS in pages"
  - "One vertical slice at a time - Phase N complete before Phase N+1"
  - "Campus-isolated - every query filters by campusId"
  - "Student autonomy first - every feature asks: does this give students more control?"
  - "Leader-first GTM - club leaders are the initial users, they pull in members"

# ============================================
# ANTI-GOALS
# ============================================
anti_goals:
  - "Not competing with Instagram on content (no influencer features)"
  - "Not a messaging app (GroupMe exists, we integrate)"
  - "Not university-controlled (students own this)"
  - "Not multi-campus yet (win UB first)"
  - "Not monetizing students (no ads, no data selling)"

# ============================================
