# HIVE Strategy
# GTM Sprint Context

project: hive
version: 2
updated: "2026-01-19"
mode: "GTM Sprint"
deadline: "Monday"

# ============================================
# THESIS
# ============================================
thesis: |
  Students will adopt HIVE if it gives them genuine control over their
  campus experience — finding what's happening, joining communities that
  matter, building campus identity, and creating their own tools.

  The key insight: Instagram is "owned" by Meta. HIVE is owned by students.
  This ownership difference creates a fundamentally different product.

# ============================================
# CONTEXT
# ============================================
context:
  who: |
    University at Buffalo students (32k TAM). Primary: club leaders,
    student org presidents, active community members. Secondary:
    general student body seeking belonging.

  problem: |
    Students use Instagram to coordinate campus life, but Instagram
    was built for global audiences, not campus communities. Students
    can't find events, can't coordinate groups, can't build campus
    identity. They have no control over the tools that shape their
    daily life.

  market: |
    Campus social/coordination market. Competitors: Instagram (dominant
    but wrong product), GroupMe (messaging only), Discord (no campus
    context), university apps (unloved). Window: 2025-2026 while campus
    social is fragmented.

  timing: |
    January 2026 production launch at UB. Leader-first GTM with 400+
    pre-seeded spaces. Win UB first, then expand to other campuses.

# USER PSYCHOLOGY
# ============================================
psychology:
  leaders:
    emotional_reality:
      - "Pride mixed with imposter syndrome"
      - "Overwhelmed but won't admit it"
      - "Frustrated with fragmented tools"
      - "Fear of being the one who killed the org"
    what_lands: "Power, control, agency. 'I can actually build the org I imagine.'"
    first_touch_magic:
      - "Recognition: HIVE knows my org exists"
      - "Claim: One-click ownership"
      - "Life: Space isn't empty"
      - "Power: Tools appear instantly"
      - "Invite: Share link works"

  members:
    emotional_reality:
      - "Belonging hunger (especially freshmen)"
      - "Social anxiety (joining is scary)"
      - "Default to passive consumption"
      - "FOMO battles inertia"
    what_lands: "Discovery, belonging, ease. 'My people are here.'"
    first_touch_magic:
      - "Preview: See before committing"
      - "Frictionless: Magic link join"
      - "Friends: See who's here"
      - "No demands: Lurk freely"
      - "Low stakes: React to something"

# ============================================
# THE THREE LOOPS
# ============================================
loops:
  leader:
    name: "Leader Loop (Acquisition)"
    flow: "Leader claims space → Invites members → Content attracts more → Status → More leaders"

  builder:
    name: "Builder Loop (Engagement)"
    flow: "Explore HiveLab → Create tool → Deploy → Others use → Recognition"

  event:
    name: "Event Loop (Retention)"
    flow: "Space posts event → RSVP → Calendar → Attend → Meet people → Join more spaces"

# ============================================
# CONSTRAINTS
# ============================================
constraints:
  - "Use locked primitives - no custom CSS in pages"
  - "Vertical slices by priority - P0 before P1 before P2"
  - "Campus-isolated - every query filters by campusId"
  - "Student autonomy first - every feature asks: does this give students more control?"
  - "Leader-first GTM - club leaders are the initial users, they pull in members"
  - "Gold is earned - 1% of screens maximum"
  - "Motion tiers - T1 for celebrations, T2 for standard, T3 for micro"
