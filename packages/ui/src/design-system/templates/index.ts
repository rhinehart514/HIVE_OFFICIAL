/**
 * HIVE Design System - Templates
 * Source: docs/design-system/TEMPLATES.md
 *
 * Templates are page-level structures that define WHERE content goes.
 * They are emotional architectures, not just layouts.
 *
 * The 5 Template Archetypes:
 * - Focus: Controlled revelation (auth, onboarding)
 * - Shell: Living navigation frame (wrapper for authenticated pages)
 * - Stream: Temporal content flow (chat, feed)
 * - Grid: Curated discovery (browse, gallery)
 * - Workspace: Creation studio (IDE, editors)
