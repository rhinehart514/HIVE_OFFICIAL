# Foundations Checklist

| Component | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ThemeProvider / Tokens | ☐ | Publish tokens via CSS vars + TS. Includes color, spacing, radius, elevation, motion, breakpoints, z-layers. |
| ModeProvider | ☐ | Switch `data-emotion` (`calm/warm/celebrate/urgent`), align with reduced motion + high-contrast. |
| I18n / LocaleProvider | ☐ | Provide campus timezone + locale-specific formatting. |
| ReducedMotionProvider | ☐ | Respect system preference; expose toggle for QA. |
| Token docs story | ☐ | Palette, typography, spacing, motion reference. |
| Emotion mode story | ☐ | Demonstrate UI blocks in calm/warm/celebrate/urgent. |

> Foundations must ship first—every component references these tokens/providers.
